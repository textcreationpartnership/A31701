         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Character of a <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere are four Virtues properly called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, which are <hi>Piety, Prudence, Valour,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and if a Prince hath not a ſhare of them, he will hardly anſwer the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his People, nor the Ends of Government; but he may be flattered into four Vices as like them, which will utterly undo him and his Subjects too; and that is if his Biggotry be called <hi>Piety,</hi> his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Cautiouſneſs and unſteady Steering <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> his Raſhneſs and Obſtinacy <hi>Valour,</hi> and his Severity and inhuman Stiffneſs <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True <hi>Piety</hi> in a Prince is a ſenſe of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Providence and Juſtice, a Submiſſion to the eternal Law of Equity, a Knowledg of his own mortal Condition and Frailties, and a deſire to keep the Bonds of Union entire between all his Subjects. As for this or that Party in Religion, he muſt ſee it be Religion and not Faction, and ſo far indulge it, as Conſcience may be ſatisfied and Ambition diſappointed: This can be done by none, but by one who has been bred up in ſome acquaintance with Moderation, and has
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98743:3"/>not ſworn to advance a Party. Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has been too far clogg'd by Ornament, Superſtition, Superſtructure, Impoſitions, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Queſtions, and more unneceſſary Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, ever to hope that any one Party ſhall ſubdue the other by Argument or dint of Reaſon ſo as to bring them over; then there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Force, which is of ſuch ill conſequence, that it is the only way to baniſh all ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion out of the World: Therefore a mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, an Allowance or permiſſive Indulgence to Miſtakes or Pre-poſſeſſions, is all that is left, and more than this Man can not invent with any good meaning to his Fellow-Creature. A Prince who has been uſed to this, who is not ſtartled at Names, who deſires to be a Father to his People, and not a Tool to his Prieſts, is the Prince that <hi>England</hi> wants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prudence,</hi> tho of ſo large an extent, as to ſeem to include all Virtues. <hi>Nullum numen abeſt ſi ſit Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia:</hi> yet it properly means in a Prince, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable forecaſt of Events, that dexterous Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering of Accidents, that ſagacious diſcovery of ſecret Machinations both at home and abroad, ſo as to prevent them in their birth, and above all, the underſtanding of the Intereſt that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is engaged in by their Circumſtances. A Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is compoſed of private Men, all brought up very near in the ſame Cuſtoms, and inſtructed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98743:3"/>much by the ſame ſort of Teachers: the Prince muſt take them as he finds them. He that would introduce Monarchy into <hi>Holland,</hi> which will drown for Liberty at any time, or ſettle a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick in <hi>France,</hi> which will and does as eagerly fight for Slavery, will have a Task of no ſmall performance. <hi>England</hi> has always been the Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer between theſe extreams; and tho that be a troubleſom Office, and ſomtimes may be unable to keep all ſteddy, yet the inconvenience is ſoon felt on either ſide, and as ſoon remedied by the weight of Intereſt: But a wiſe Prince will eaſily keep the Contenders quiet, if he reflects, he can only be ſafe by preventing the exceſs; they who would make him Abſolute, would kill him with kindneſs, make him debaſe Human Nature, diveſt his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Reaſon, by which alone Men can obey ſweetly, and at laſt expoſe him to all the Rage and inſolent Infidelity of mercenary Guards and ſenſeleſs Slaves: And thoſe who would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe him of neceſſary Power, would make him a reſtleſs Tool to ambitious Projects, uncapable of protecting his People, a perpetual Martyr to Fears and Jealouſies, while he would be endeavouring to perform his Office; all his Actions liable to Miſconſtructions, and in ſhort, put him into ſo regular a Diet, that the leaſt good Meal of Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Power would prove a Surfeit. Therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98743:4"/>the Prince we want, is one accuſtomed to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Projects of others, us'd to preſide in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſſemblies, that ſo fathoming the Depth of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Combinations, he may ſee the danger of giving colourable Pretexts by arbitrary Proceedings, and likewiſe avoid ſplitting upon the Sand of too much Confidence in his own Judgment and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement. In ſhort, he that has managed great Councils, will never be managed by little ones, and ſo never drawn aſide from his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valour</hi> is ſo eſſential a Quality in a Prince, that it is part of his being. <hi>Omnia ſunt Gladii pediſſequa;</hi> and the Sword is delivered to him by a more divine Commiſſion than any other of his Attributes. God allowed the Plea in his own People, when they rejected the Government of the Prieſthood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand one to lead them in and out to Battel. Since the peaceable Principles of Chriſtianity, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to tame the ferocity of Heatheniſm, have not been able entirely to baniſh Arms and War, and that at leaſt defenſively, it muſt be allowed; 'tis moſt certain, that a Prince without <hi>Valour</hi> is not to be relied upon for Protection: and tho of late perhaps ſome have troubled the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that perſonal Quality, yet our Nation will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a profound Veneration for one who ſhall head it in glorious Actions. What will they have then for a Hero, who from his firſt Manhood
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98743:4"/>has withſtood the torrent of impetuous Invaſion? who has in the midſt of Fire and Smoak preſerved all the Security and Calmneſs that Men have at leiſure hours, and yet ſhewed all the Spirit and Conduct that Danger required. There goes a great deal to the making of a General, but much more to have a Sovereign be eminent in Generalſhip; and when ſuch a Prince falls to a Nations lot, they may boldly hope to find reſpect in the remoteſt parts of this habitable World, particularly having Fleets to carry the Glory of their Prince to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juſtice</hi> is the finiſhing of that true Picture of God Almighty, a Prince; that which makes him look lovely in the Eyes of all his Subjects, from the higheſt to the loweſt; but it muſt be tempered with <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is properly the Juſtice of his own Nature, the other is the utmoſt reſult of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reaſon into Rules called Laws, of which the Prince is the Guardian, and ought particularly to watch the Adminiſtration of them, for they cannot be ſtrained or ſlackened without a jarring in the Harmony of Government. At this moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualification are levelled all the Batteries of the Rapacious or the Flattring: Here they place In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and would have the Prince believe that his Will is the Fountain-Head, that all the Streams may take what Channel he pleaſes, and this that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98743:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſome of them may be diverted to their uſe. Few Men truſt to Merit, moſt to Favour, that makes them ſtrive for Power, and make it uphold its own Extravagancies, even with the hazard of the Princes ſafety and the Peoples quiet: And ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily fertile are unjuſt Acts, that they beget one another, and like the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> do but harden Hearts: Nothing can ſo ſoon overturn a Government as the want of Juſtice. Politick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are never diſſolved till they are in a ſtate of War, and they are never ſo, till every Man is his own Carver, for want of an equal diſtributive Power.</p>
            <p>A Prince therefore whoſe Birth and Education has been in a Country where Laws flouriſh, and Property is ſacred, whoſe Nature is juſt, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per merciful, who has refuſed Sovereign Power, becauſe he would be true to his Truſt, who has over-worn Fears and Jealouſies, where they were ſupported with ſpecious Pretences and foreign Aſſiſtances, who has gained his Enemies, reconcil'd his Oppoſers, and powerfully protected his Friends, that Prince, if we are wiſe, may make us happy.</p>
